##Q1
Supervised learning uses a labeled data set to train an algorithm. Unsupervised learning does not us labeled data, and instead finds patterns and clusters in the data provided.

##Q2
Regression models in ML predict a numerical, qualitative variable. Classification models in ML predict a qualitative/categorical variable.

##Q3
Regression ML metrics: Training MSE, expected Test MSE, 
Classification ML metrics: Training Error Rate, Bayes Error Rate 

```{r}

```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
